This course follows on from the Puppet 4: Working with files and templates courses. In this course you will learn to add Hiera to Puppet to abstract Puppet code from the implementation.

Means : Without modification to the Puppet code or passing parameters to classes, Hiera provides a lookup data-source. Enabling custom values to be rettrieved from configuration data rather than within the code.

2.2 Demonstration Hiera Lookups
- Download the ntp_start.tgz to your home directory
- Move into the /etc/puppetlabs/code environments/ production/modules directory
- Expand the archive with sudo tar -xzvf ~/ntp_start.tgz

sudo puppet apply -d -e 'include ntp' 

sudo puppet apply -d -e 'include ntp' | grep hiera

Configuration : The Hiera configuration file is often known as the hiera.yaml file. The file is used to configure the hierarchy of backends to be used for lookups
Backends : Can be written in yaml or json formats
Lookup Functions:
 - hiera() - lookup for single value
 - hiera_array() - lookup for multiple values
 - hiera_hash() - index array from we can use
 
Automatic Parameter Lookup: Puppet automatically retrives class parameters from Hiera. This is regular and predictable and anyone downloading a module can reference the first line of a class to determine the keys that need to be set.
