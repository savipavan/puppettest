Puppet Master / Agent Architecture
---------------------------------
Managing Infrastructure
Puppet Master -- Compile Catalog
Puppet Agent -- Applies Catalog
Configuration Management/Configuration Drift
Centralized Reporting and Inventory

Benefits : 
  Reporting Aggregation
  Redundancy And Scalability
 
 Puppet Stand-Alone Architecture
 -------------------------------
 -No Puppet Master and Accompnaying
 - Simple "Puppet Apply" exceution
 - Local catalog compliation and application
 - Lower setup overhead
    - Ephemeral Environments
  
  puppet apply -e "include <class>"
  
  puppet apply <file>.pp
  
  puppet apply --hiera-config /etc/puppet/hiera.yaml
  
  Puppet Apply with Docker
  -----------------------
  - Puppet Apply is invoked from the Dockerfile
  - Docker container is ephermeral
  - common infrastructural components can still be leveraged
  - r10k is used to install the Puppet Module set required for the configuration of the Docker container
  - Hiera contains all of the static configuration for the container
  
  puppet apply --modulepath /etc/puppet/modules --hiera-config /etc/puppet/hiera.yaml
