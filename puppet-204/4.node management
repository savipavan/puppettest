4. Certificate Signing Request:
	puppet server includes a certificate authority(CA) service that accepts certificate signing requests(CSRs) from nodes, serves certificates and a certificate revocation list(CRL) to nodes, and optionally accepts commands to sign or revoke certificates
		- when you install a new PE agent, the agent will automatically submit a certificate signing request(CSR) to the Puppet master.
		- Before Puppet agent nodes can retrieve their configuration catalogs, the certificate needs to be signed by the certificate authority(CA).
	
commad :
	pupppet cert
	puppet cert list
	puppet cert sign <NAME>
	puppet cert revoke <NAME>
	
DNS Altnames:
	puppet cert sign <HOSTNAME> or -all_ --allow-dns-alt-name<NAME>
	On the Puppet Master:
		- puppet cert clean<NAME>
	- Deleting SSL certs on agent:
		- cp -r /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl_bak

Auto Signing:
	- Should only be used when the environment fully trusts any computer able to connect to the Puppet Master.
	- The CA uses a config file contains a whitelist of certificate names and domain names.
		- $condir/autosign.conf
		- *.domain.com
	- To disable autosigning
		- autosign = false in the [master] in puppet.conf
Demos:
	puppet cert list
	puppet cert list -a
	
	#on a node:
	cd /etc/puppetlabs/puppet
	ls
	rm -rf ssl
	
	#on master
	puppet cert clean dmo_agent
	
	#on agent :
	puppet agent -t
	
	#when we check the alt_names fist stop puppet service
	on node:
	service puppet stop
	vi puppet.conf
		dns_alt_names = demo_agent
	#delete ssl dir
		rm ssl
	on master:
		puppet cert clean dmo_agent
	on node: puppet agent -t
	on master : puppet cert sign node1.jhanci.com --allow-dns-alt-names
	puppet cert list -a

4.2 Running the Puppet Agent:
-----------------------------
Spin up Ubuntu Node
ssh to the new ubuntu node
copy agent url from PE-Console and install in agent node
go classification in pe console -> pe-master -> claasess -> search for pe_repo:platform:ubuntu:14-04

run puppet run on mater to take effect
	puppet agent -t
on node: run puppet agent URL again

on puppet master:
#ew can find new ubunt repo
cd /etc/puppetlabs/server/data/packages/public/current
or
/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/packages/public/2016.4.2/

on ubuntu node:
fix issue:
cd /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/
vi 90pe-repo-fix
	APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated 1;
:wq!

run the puppet agent url again
#command to fix the problem:
#echo 'APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated 1;' >/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90pe-repo-fix

on node: run the install.bash command URL and install puppet agent

on master:
#sign certificate:
puppet cert list -a
puppet cert sign node2.jhanci.com
# run puppet agent -t on node

open console -> classification -> create Ubuntu --> add new node2 to the group

#check noop when run command
first stop service in node
service puppet stop
puppet agent -t --noop

puppet agent --help

chown pe-puppet:pe-puppet -R stage/
